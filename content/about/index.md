My name is Vincent Zalzal. I am a C++ software developer from Montr√©al, Canada. I've been working in the computer vision industry since 2006.

I enjoy writing efficient, modern C++ to solve all kinds of mathematical problems. I like the low-level challenges of optimizing memory access patterns as much as the high-level challenges of writing elegant, maintainable code.

I am a math-oriented programmer and enjoy solving problems involving linear algebra, projective geometry, robust statistics or data fitting.

In my spare time, I tinker with Atmel 8-bit microcontrollers (or write blog posts, it seems!). Since I love math, I also watch multiple "recreational" mathematics YouTube channels, like [Mathologer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1_uAIS3r8Vu6JjXWvastJg) and [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile).

On the lighter side, I enjoy playing board games (including a quick game of [Coup](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/131357/coup) during lunch) and some indie computer games too, like [The Messenger](https://store.steampowered.com/app/764790/The_Messenger/), [Furi](https://store.steampowered.com/app/423230/Furi/) and [TIS-100](https://store.steampowered.com/app/370360/TIS100/).

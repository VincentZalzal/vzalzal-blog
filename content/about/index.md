My name is Vincent Zalzal. I am a C++ software developer from Montr√©al, Canada. I've been working in the computer vision industry since 2006.

I enjoy writing efficient, modern C++ to solve all kinds of mathematical problems. I like the low-level challenges of optimizing memory access patterns as much as the high-level challenges of writing elegant, maintainable code.

I am a math-oriented programmer and enjoy solving problems involving linear algebra, projective geometry, robust statistics or data fitting.

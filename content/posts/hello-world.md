What better way to start a new coding blog than with a "Hello, World!" post :)

<!--more-->

I've been using C++ at work and at University for the last 20 years. C++ software development landscape has changed a lot since then, but I've always loved learning. I try to stay on top of things. I follow multiple blogs and watch many talks at C++ conferences on YouTube.

However, there is no better way to learn than by trying to explain things to others. I've posted twice on Jonathan Boccara's [Fluent C++](https://www.fluentcpp.com/) blog, and I enjoyed it. So, the next logical step was to start my own blog.

This is an experiment. I have no idea for how long I will be doing this or how frequently. Still, I hope that I'll share with you some interesting thoughts, and that we will grow together as professional software developers.

See you soon!
